## Features

-   [x] It's just awesome!

## Requirements

-   iOS 16.0+ / macOS 13.3+ / tvOS 16.4+ / watchOS 9.4+
-   Xcode 14.3.1+
-   Swift 5.8+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but Alamofire does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
.package(url: "https://github.com/DoubleNode/DNSCore.git", from: "1.11.2")
]
```

## Dependencies

-   DNSCore v1.11.10+
